        <h3>Subject: Reconnecting to Support Your Team’s Vercel Usage</h3>
  
        <p>Hi Alex and VP of Marketing,</p>
  
        <p>
          Hope you're both doing well! I wanted to check in after noticing a 50% drop in your team’s Vercel usage this past quarter. 
          I also saw that Tanner, who had been leading the effort, has since moved on. With that change, I wanted to reconnect 
          and make sure your team is fully supported in managing your Vercel deployment.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Since Vercel plays a key role in hosting your marketing pages, I want to make sure you’re getting the most value out of your 
          $22K ARR subscription. I also noticed some build errors in your history and, given that you’re working with a single developer 
          and a Cloudflare reverse proxy, I’d love to understand whether there’s anything we can do to help streamline things or reduce challenges.  
        </p>
  
        <h4 style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>A few things I’d love to understand:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>With Tanner’s departure, how has your team adjusted to managing Vercel?</li>
          <li>Have there been any shifts in marketing priorities or campaign strategies that might be affecting how you’re using Vercel?</li>
          <li>Is your developer running into any technical roadblocks that could be impacting build frequency?</li>
          <li>How has the Cloudflare reverse proxy been working for you? Any performance concerns or challenges? 
            <a href="https://vercel.com/guides/can-i-use-a-proxy-on-top-of-my-vercel-deployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> This Cloudflare + Vercel guide</a> might be helpful if adjustments are needed.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          If a quick sync would be helpful, I’m happy to find a time that works for you. Or, if async works better, I can share insights via email instead. 
          Let me know what’s easiest for you!
        </p>
  
        <p>Looking forward to catching up.</p>
  
        <p>Warm regards,</p>
        <p>Taylor</p>
