          I had a blast with this exercise—it was super fun to dive into Next.js and Vercel, and I love how it let me sharpen my skills. The PDF did a solid job guiding me through, which I appreciated, especially for setting up and tackling the questions.

          One idea to make it even smoother: how about a quick meeting to go over the take-home exercise before we start? It’d help clear up any confusion upfront, like figuring out Q4’s video and text parts. Even with the PDF’s help, a live chat could save some head-scratching and get us rolling faster.

          This could make it easier for everyone while still testing how we handle docs and communication. I really enjoyed it, and I think this tweak could make it even more awesome! Let me know if you want to bounce this idea around—I’d love to chat!
