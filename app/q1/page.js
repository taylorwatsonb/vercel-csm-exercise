        <h3>Subject: React vs. Next.js – Optimizing Your Marketing Pages</h3>
  
        <p>Hi Christy,</p>
  
        <p>
          Appreciate you reaching out! Since your focus is on performance, SEO, and conversions,  
          I’ll break this down in a way that ties directly to your marketing goals.
        </p>
  
        <h4 style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>React vs. Next.js – What’s the Difference?</h4>
        <p>
          React is great for building interactive UI components, but it doesn’t handle full-page optimization out of the box.  
          Next.js builds on React and adds performance, SEO, and scalability features that help marketing pages load faster and rank better.

        <h4 style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>Why Next.js is a Better Fit for Marketing Pages</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Better Performance – Pages are pre-built using  
            <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              Static Generation</a>, so they load instantly instead of waiting for the browser to render content.
          </li>
          <li>
            SEO Optimization – Automatic metadata management, clean URLs, and built-in optimizations  
            help improve search rankings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Faster Load Times = Higher Conversions – Studies show even a 1-second delay can drop conversion rates.  
            Next.js improves  
            <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/improve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              Core Web Vitals</a> like LCP and FCP, keeping visitors engaged.
          </li>
          <li>
            Automatic Image Optimization – Next.js serves images in the best format and size, speeding up load times.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simpler Maintenance – No need to manually configure things like code splitting, caching, or lazy loading—it’s built in.
          </li>
        </ul>
  
       
        <p>
          If your team is looking to improve page speed, search visibility, and conversions,  
          Next.js is designed to handle that efficiently without extra development work.  
          If you’d like, I can share real-world case studies of marketing teams that have seen performance gains with Next.js.
